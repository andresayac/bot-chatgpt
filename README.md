## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or server using `git clone https://github.com/andresayac/bot-chatgpt.git`
2. Navigate to the cloned project directory and run `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.
3. Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. Then, fill in the necessary environment variables in the `.env` file.

## Bot Language

By default, the bot is set to English. If you want to change the language, you can do so by changing the `LANGUAGE_BOT` variable in the `.env` file to your desired language. For example, for Spanish, you would set `LANGUAGE_BOT=es`.

## Obtaining Access Token

To complete the `.env` file, you will need to obtain an access token. You can manually get an access token by logging in to the ChatGPT webapp and then opening [https://chat.openai.com/api/auth/session](https://chat.openai.com/api/auth/session), which will return a JSON object containing your access token string.

Access tokens last for days.

Note: using a reverse proxy will expose your access token to a third-party. There shouldn't be any adverse effects possible from this, but please consider the risks before using this method.

## Running the Bot
Once you have completed the `.env` file, you can start the bot by running `npm start`.
